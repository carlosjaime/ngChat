# ngChat

[![Build Status](https://drone.io/github.com/cyrilf/ngChat/status.png)](https://drone.io/github.com/cyrilf/ngChat/latest)

A tiny-chat application with Angular, Socket.IO and NodeJs

[![windmill](https://raw.github.com/cyrilf/ngChat/master/ngchat.png)](http://ngchat.herokuapp.com)

> A live version can be found here : [ngChat on Heroku](http://ngchat.herokuapp.com/)

:grey_exclamation: Heroku doesn't support websockets for now ([source](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/using-socket-io-with-node-js-on-heroku)).
That's why the live version isn't as effective as a local one.
